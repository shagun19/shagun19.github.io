    			<p style="text-align:justify" class="test">I am a graduate student majoring in Computer Science at University of Southern California.
					As an engineer, I strive to be a problem solver by creating solutions which can be used within
					the very fabric of the society. Through my experience as a Quality Assurance engineer
					and a Software Developer, I have worked on projects involving extensive data and impacting common
					people in real time. One such example was contributing to a data platform product which created
					advertising segments for each user, so that next time a 25 year old boy opens a mobile app,
					he gets a product recommendation for Nike sneakers and not for a Gucci purse. In another project,
					I designed and developed an optimising solution for the analytics engine, which enabled cost saving
					by 98%. Recently, I developed a block chain based voting application which could be used uniformly
					across USC to implement safe and transparent voting. I am passionate about designing and programming
					and feel there is nothing in today's era which doesn't have a digital solution. I have rich
					experience in automation testing, software design, application level development, distributed
					systems and machine learning. Troubleshooting and debugging issues in the shortest of times
					excites me the most.
