                I am a graduate student majoring in Computer Science at University of Southern California.
                As an engineer, I strive to be a problem solver by creating solutions which can be used within
                the very fabric of the society. Through my experience as a Quality Assurance engineer
                and a Software Developer, I have worked on projects involving extensive data and impacting common
                people in real time. One such example was contributing to a data platform product which created
                advertising segments for each user, so that next time a 25 year old boy opens a mobile app,
                he gets a product recommendation for Nike sneakers and not for a Gucci purse. In another project,
                I designed and developed an optimising solution for the analytics engine, which enabled cost saving
                by 98%. Recently, I developed a block chain based voting application which could be used uniformly
                across USC to implement safe and transparent voting. I am passionate about designing and programming
                and feel there is nothing in today's era which doesn't have a digital solution. I have rich
                experience in automation testing, software design, application level development, distributed
                systems and machine learning. Troubleshooting and debugging issues in the shortest of times
                excites me the most.
