				I am a graduate student majoring in Computer Science at University of Southern California.
				As an engineer, I strive to be a problem solver by creating solutions which can be used within
				the very fabric of the society. Through my experience as a Quality Assurance engineer
				and a Software Developer, I have worked on projects involving extensive data and impacting common
				people in real time. One such example was contributing to a data platform product which created
				advertising segments for each user, so that next time a 25 year old boy opens a mobile app,
				he gets a product recommendation for Nike sneakers and not for a Gucci purse. In another project,
				I designed and developed an optimising solution for the analytics engine, which enabled cost saving
				by 98%. Recently, I developed a block chain based voting application which could be used uniformly
				across USC to implement safe and transparent voting. I am passionate about designing and programming
				and feel there is nothing in today's era which doesn't have a digital solution. I have rich
				experience in automation testing, software design, application level development, distributed
				systems and machine learning. Troubleshooting and debugging issues in the shortest of times
				excites me the most.</p></div>

				<h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
				Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
