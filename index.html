				<p><img height="300" src="profile.png" alt="Supp!" title="Supp!" align="left" hspace="20" />I am a graduate student majoring in Computer Science at University of Southern California. As an engineer, I strive to be a problem solver by creating solutions which can be used within the very fabric of the society. Through my experience as a Quality Assurance engineer and a Software Developer, I have worked on projects involving extensive data and impacting common people in real time. One such example was contributing to a data platform product which created advertising segments for each user, so that next time a 25 year old boy opens a mobile app, he gets a product recommendation for Nike sneakers and not for a Gucci purse. In another project, I designed and developed an optimising solution for the analytics engine, which enabled cost saving by 98%. Recently, I developed a blockchain based voting application which could be used uniformly across USC to implement safe and transparent voting. I am passionate about designing and programming and feel there is nothing in today's era which doesn't have a digital solution. I have rich experience in automation testing, software design, application level development, distributed systems and machine learning. Troubleshooting and debugging issues in the shortest of times excites me the most.</p>
